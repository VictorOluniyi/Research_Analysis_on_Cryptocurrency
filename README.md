# Research_Analysis_on_Cryptocurrency

### ABOUT PROJECT
A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. The project is the analysis of different types of cryptocurrency over various years.
